# Detection of breast cancer using Machine Learning
The early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer can save the lives of cancer patients 
using Machine Learning.

To meet the better performance we used three models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest classifier. Therefore
we found that Random Forest Classifier model(Random Decision Forests) with the accuracy= 0.965034 is the best model followed by Decision Tree Model with accuracy= 0.937062
