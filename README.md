# Detection of breast cancer using Machine Learning
The Early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer can save the lives of cancer patients 
using Machine Learning.

To meet the better performance we used the three models such as Logisitc Regression, Decision tree and Randonm forest classifier, therefore
we found Random Forest Classifier model(Random Decision Forests)  with the accuracy= 0.965034 followed by Decision Tree Model with accuracy= 0.937062
